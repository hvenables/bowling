## Bowling Challenge

Idea is that we will split into groups and try and TDD a bowling score calculator.

I have written the starting spec for the game, it is your job to now make this pass!

I envisigned that we would do this as a mob session in your groups with the driver changing with every spec that passes
however i will leave that up to the teams how they want to run it.

To get started clone this repo `git clone git@github.com:hvenables/bowling.git`

Then run `bundle`
Then you should be able to do `bundle exec rspec` to run the tests

I would like everyone to make there own branch, commit after each spec passes, then at the end of the session we can
push up the solutions and look at everyones PR's to see how to different teams handled the problem
