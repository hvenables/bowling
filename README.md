## Bowling Challenge

Idea is that we will split into groups and try and TDD a bowling score calculator.

I have written the starting spec for the game, it is your job to now make this pass!

I envisigned that we would do this as a mob session in your groups with the driver changing with every spec that passes
however i will leave that up to the teams how they want to run it.

To get started clone this repo
> how to clone

Then run `bundle`
Then you should be able to do `bundle exec rspec` to run the tests
